          <h2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Account data:</strong> When you sign up, we collect your email address and name. This is necessary to create and manage your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Scan data:</strong> The URLs you submit for scanning are stored so you can access your scan history and re-run scans. We do not store the content of scanned pages beyond the violation data.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Payment data:</strong> All payments are handled entirely by Stripe. We never see, store, or have access to your credit card number. Your payment information is subject to Stripe&apos;s privacy policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Usage data:</strong> We track basic usage (pages visited, features used) to improve the product. This is anonymous and not tied to any identifying information beyond your account.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cookies:</strong> We use only essential session cookies required for login to work. We do not use tracking cookies, advertising cookies, or analytics cookies from third parties.
          </p>

          <h2 id="how-we-use-data">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide and operate the scanning service.</li>
            <li>To send you scan results and monitoring alerts (if enabled).</li>
            <li>To process payments via Stripe.</li>
            <li>To respond to support requests.</li>
            <li><strong>We do NOT sell your data to any third party. Ever.</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="data-storage">3. Data Storage & Security</h2>
          <p>
            All data is stored in Supabase, hosted on AWS infrastructure that is SOC2 compliant. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt — we cannot see them. Scan URLs are stored with Row-Level Security enabled, meaning you can only access your own data.
          </p>

          <h2 id="your-rights">4. Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right to access:</strong> Email us at support@wcagscanner.com and we&apos;ll send you all your data within 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to deletion:</strong> Email us and we&apos;ll delete your account and all associated data within 7 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to correction:</strong> Update your profile information anytime in the Settings page.</li>
            <li><strong>Right to portability:</strong> Request a CSV export of your scan history.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="cookies">5. Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            We use only essential session cookies — no tracking cookies, no analytics cookies, no third-party advertising cookies.
          </p>

          <h2 id="third-party">6. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <ul>
