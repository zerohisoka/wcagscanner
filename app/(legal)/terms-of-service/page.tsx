          <h2 id="description">2. Description of Service</h2>
          <p>
            WCAG Scanner provides automated WCAG accessibility scanning for websites. We use the open-source axe-core engine to detect common accessibility violations. Our automated scans detect approximately 57% of WCAG issues — not all issues. Results are for informational purposes only.
          </p>

          <h2 id="disclaimer">3. ⚠️ Critical Disclaimer — Automated Scanning Limitations</h2>

              <li>We CANNOT and DO NOT guarantee that your website is fully WCAG or ADA compliant.</li>
              <li>A passing score on our tool does not protect you from legal action.</li>
              <li>For full legal compliance, consult a qualified accessibility expert and attorney.</li>
              <li>We are not liable for any lawsuits, fines, or damages arising from your use of scan results.</li>
            </ul>

          </p>

          <h2 id="refund">6. Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            We offer a 7-day refund for first-time subscribers who are not satisfied. Refunds are not available after 7 days or for subsequent billing cycles. To request a refund, email support@wcagscanner.com within 7 days of charge.
